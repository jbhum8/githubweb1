REQUIREMENTS
============

* Login Screen:
	* Username and Password field
	* Must check against an API for validity of username and password
	* Notify user whether username and password is valid
	* If username and password are valid, then hide the login screen and present the Task List screen
* Task List Screen:
	* If user is not logged in, then either notify them that login is required to view tasks, or redirect them to the Login Screen
	* If user is logged in:
		* Show list of current tasks. Print a message that the task list is empty if there are no tasks
		* Ability to add tasks
		* Ability to delete tasks
		* Ability to edit tasks
		* If user logs out, shuts down computer, and logs in again, they should still be able to see the last set of saved tasks


EXTRA
=====
If you do more than just the requirements, you can get more grades.  Things you can consider doing are:

* Building a search filter to filter tasks by things such as keywords, status, date, etc...
* Making sub tasks
* Ability to reorder tasks
* Show tasks that are due within X number of days as an aside
* Implement nice interface with CSS
* Make the application WCAG Level AA compliant
* Create more user friendly confirmation notices for certain user actions (eg. user friendly prompts for a failed login, or confirmation that task has been added, etc...)

You can be creative and make up new requirements to make your task list application more usable.
